# TrinityJS
## Before reading
Documentation is beeing prepared and will be changing often. Please be aware of that while reading. Ale project itself is not yet even in alfa version - so just a big TODO :D. However any comments, issues posts or feature request are warmly welcomed :)

### What is it?
Trinity js is a lightweight javascript "framework" based on new ES6/2015 javascript specification. Whole repository is wrapped as jspm package.

### Why it is different?
On the market there are already many awesome and very well maintained frameworks. So why create new one? Well we asked ourself this question many and many times.
